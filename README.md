# ðŸš€ Personal Finance Dashboard ðŸ“Š

I've been working on building practical applications to solidify my programming fundamentals. This dashboard allows users to easily track their income and expenses and gain insights through basic financial reports.

**What it does:**
* **Add Transactions:** Quickly log new income and expense entries.
* **View Transactions:** See a clear overview of all recorded financial activities.
* **Generate Reports:** Visualize spending patterns and financial trends (with more advanced reporting features planned!).

**Key Technologies Used:**
* **Python:** The backbone of the application.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive and user-friendly web interface.
* **SQLite:** For local, persistent data storage.
* **Pandas:** For efficient data handling and preparation.

This project has been an incredible journey, strengthening my skills in **UI development, database interaction, data management, and fundamental problem-solving.** It's exciting to see how code can solve real-world problems!

Looking forward to expanding its features and continuing to learn. Any feedback or insights from the community are welcome!
